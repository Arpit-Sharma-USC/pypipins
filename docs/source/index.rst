PyPI Shields/Pins are shields for you GitHub repo, documentation or website that show
your many times your project has been downloaded from PyPI or it's latest version.

Please note, due to how PyPI works, you'll need to use the exact name of your PyPI package
i.e.

- Sphinx not sphinx
- Django not django

You will need to replace **PYPI_PKG_NAME** with your package name.
